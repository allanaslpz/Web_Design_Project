        <p>Due to its geography, the Philippines is interspersed with rolling mountain ranges, stunning viewpoints, and beautiful natural landscapes. While the Philippines is a lot more famous for its incredible islands and beaches, it doesn’t mean that the mountains here aren’t as noteworthy. So whether you love a challenge, enjoy the outdoors, or just like to be active, there’s no shortage of choice when it comes to the Philippines.</p>

            <h2>Mount Pinatubo</h2>
            <h3>Simply breathtaking</h3>
            
            <p>Famously known for being the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century, the original mountain stood at 1,745 meters before its summit was destroyed.</p>

            <p>Today, the now peaceful Mount Pinatubo is surrounded by valleys of ash and an incredible crater lake full of white sand and turquoise waters.</p>

            <h2>Mount Pulag</h2>
            <h3>Playground of the Gods</h3>

             <p>Mount Pulag is an extremely popular mountain to climb, even for people who aren’t hikers or mountaineers, for one reason only: the sea of clouds!</p>

             <p>Mount Pulag is the only mountain in the Philippines where you literally walk through this sea of clouds.</p>

            <h2>Mount Mayon</h2>
            <h3>Iconic perfect cone shape</h3>

            <p>Mt. Mayon is one of those mountains that is well known all over the Philippines popularized for its iconic perfect cone shape.  Apart from Mt. Fuji in Japan, there are only two mountains in the world that are perfectly symmetrical.</p>

            <p>Ironically, it is the most active volcano in the Philippines with its last major eruption wiping out the entire town of Cagsawa. Climbing up Mt. Mayon usually takes 2-3 day climb where you face some pretty challenging trails.</p>
