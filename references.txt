Due to its geography, the Philippines is interspersed with rolling mountain ranges, stunning viewpoints, and beautiful natural landscapes.

While the Philippines is a lot more famous for its incredible islands and beaches, it doesn’t mean that the mountains here aren’t as noteworthy.

So whether you love a challenge, enjoy the outdoors, or just like to be active, there’s no shortage of choice when it comes to the Philippines.

Famously known for being the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century, the original mountain stood at 1,745 meters before its summit was destroyed. Although a terrible disaster, the resulting fertility of land has created a landscape which is simply breathtaking.
Today, the now peaceful Mount Pinatubo is surrounded by valleys of ash and an incredible crater lake full of white sand and turquoise waters. Whether you’re taking on the trek to the top, or opting for the 4×4 ride for some of the way, this is by far the most historical views you will see.

Mount Pulag is an extremely popular mountain to climb, even for people who aren’t hikers or mountaineers, for one reason only: the sea of clouds!

Mount Pulag is the only mountain in the Philippines where you literally walk through this sea of clouds.

If that’s not cool enough (which it totally is), this hike also takes you through a range of vegetation, from pine and mossy forests to vast and open grasslands at the summit. With stunning 360-degree views of the Cordillera to finish, it is worth the climb up

Filipino food is a mixture of sweet, salty, and sour flavours. Rice figures heavily — this is Southeast Asia, after all!

The Filipino foods we eat today are a direct fusion of indigenous ingredients, flavours, and outside influence. With such a wide geography and rich indigenous history, each area of the Philippines reflects these influences in local variations of popular dishes.
